    ###THE CONCEPT
    """
    Based on a "Day/night" cycle. It is defined by the Clock process.
    There is a lot of houses, defined by the House processes, and a Market process.
    The Market Process creates an External process.
    The Weather Process is used to know how much energy the houses create (with the enlightment factor)...
    ... and use (with the temperature factor).
    
    On the Day (Clock.value = 1) :
    The HOUSES calculate their energy consommation and production.
    The HOUSES THAT WANT TO GIVE ENERGY communicate, through the message queue "messageQueueHouses", the energy they want to give.
    The HOUSES THAT WANT TO RECEIVE ENERGY are picking messages from the message queue (first arrived, first served), and send a message through the giver private message queue.
    The HOUSES THAT GIVES ENERGY adapt the amount of energy they have.
    The MARKET calculates the price of the energy if this is not the first day.
    
    On the Night (Clock.value = 0) :
    The HOUSES send to the market their energy need OR their extra energy amount.
    The MARKET sends to the houses the money they have to pay OR the money they earn.
    
    Everytime :
    The EXTERNAL process can, at any moment, signal a disaster to the market.
    The MAIN process deliver the user some data to follow the evolution of the events.
